This is the repository for the second assessment of SDV503

The program that has been written is a simple tic-tac-toe game
When node . is typed in the terminal, a 3x3 game board is created, that fills X's and O's randomly until one of the letters is the first to create a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of their letter.
Once this has happened, the game will finish.
If neither of the letters can create a line of their letter, and the game board is full, the game will be classified as a draw and will come to an end.

To run this program, make sure that you have a code editor such as Visual Studio Code that has a terminal, and you have the node.js runtime installed on your computer.

Enjoy!
